**The Idea**  
The projects starts with the idea of allowing an interaction between the users in an online space, along with the attempt of making it a pleasent experience that will make the world a better place.
The user will have the chance to succeed in the challenge we present him, only if he helps other people win.

**The Project**  
The main interface of the website will be a map, through which the user can move in a delimited radius: the only way to explore the map is by walking around in real life.
On the map the user will find some colorful packets, left by other users, which can be opened; the user himself will have the possibility to leave packets around.

**Code challenges**  
From a coding point of view, having so many interactions based on the smartphone movements.
We tried to create different canvases, but weren’t able to upload the geolocation on the presets, as it not possible to have a preload function inside multiple canvasses. So we decided to use an if cycle to move from an interaction to another.  
Also, some of the features as frame count work differently from
Inspirations/References
Our main inspirations have been the social-detox apps that help the users to reduce the time spent on social networks. Most of these apps mute the notifications or reward the users in different ways the less they use the smartphone.

**How does it work?**
The user will be able to open only the packets inside a specifical radius, the objects further than that distance will be seen in black and white, meaning that if the user doesn’t move and get closer to them, he can’t interact with the content.
The packets can be either searched and opened or left around by the user, through a button and a peculiar gesture.

**The Content**
The content of the packet will be a Christmas-themed postcard, with a custom illustration and a positive message, which the user will choose between some options.
There will be a certain number of illustration, and the user will have to try and find as more as possible. When the user leaves a packets he won’t know what the illustration is, also he won’t be able to open his own packets.

**The Challenge**
Every time the user access to the website, he will have time to collect all the different illustrations and to leave the packets around (so the game will go on) until he stays on the website.
Every time he reconnects he will have to start over.
